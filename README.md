# Nick's .NET Backend Developer Roadmap for 2023

Hey there ðŸ‘‹. This is my (very opinionated) roadmap for .NET developers that want to focus on backend and specifically work with microservices.

In cases where I used cloud specific technology, like Azure Cosmos DB and AWS DynamoDB, you can assume that I also include the equivelent tech from other cloud providers like GCP.

I will try to keep updating this roadmap as the technology landscape is evolving.
